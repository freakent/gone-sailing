## What to expect
A day out on a sailing boat is an incredibly fun but different kind of experience. Our water usage, power conservation and toilet procedures maybe a little different to what you are used to. As long as you don’t mind adapting to this style of living for the time you are onboard, we think you will really enjoy it. On a boat many hands make light work. Whether it’s mooring up, sailing the boat or simply tidying up, we’d encourage everyone on board to chip in. There are no passengers on our ship, everyone is crew!

## Safety
We take safety very seriously on board, we hope you will too.  We have life jackets and safety lines for everyone on board. Everyone is expected to wear a lifejacket when on deck whilst under way or when asked to do so. A full safety brief will be given before we leave the dock so that everyone on board knows what to do in the unlikely event of an emergency. A safe crew is a happy crew.

## What to bring

#### Clothes
Whilst we’d like to be able to promise bikini and cocktail weather all the time, the truth is that the weather in the Solent and along the South Coast is variable. The best advice is to wear layers on both your top and bottom half as appropriate. A light weight waterproof jacket would be a wise precaution and avoid denim at all costs because once it is wet it stays wet. 

#### Footwear
Anika has beautiful wooden decks and wood floors down below, so we’d appreciate it if you wear clean, non-marking, non-slip shoes (or boots) when on board, keeping your “shore shoes” separate from your on-board shoes. Boots are good for keeping your feet warm and dry on board but so are a good pair of waterproof socks.

#### Sun protection
Hopefully we will be outside in the sunshine most of the time we are sailing. A hat is always a good idea, either to protect you from the sun or keep the rain out of your eyes, just make sure it won’t blow off your head in the breeze. Don’t forget sun cream and your sun glasses.

## Sea Sickness
We recognise that some people are unfortunately affected by sea sickness. If you know you suffer from sea sickness please let us know before we depart and take appropriate steps to look after yourself. This YouTube video has some good advice for dealing with sea sicknesses.

## Aye Aye, Captain
Martin and Julie are the acting captains of our ship and the captain always gets the final say.  Period.  We are liable for our vessel and everyone’s safety when on board.  It’s a great responsibility and one we take seriously.

## How to find us
Anika is berthed at Mercury Yacht Harbour, Satchell Lane, Hamble. SO31 4HQ
There is ample free car parking and parking for our visitors is not a problem. We are moored on Pontoon B. The entrance to Pontoon B is to the right-hand side of the car park as you enter, by the Hamble School Of Yachting building. 
Entrance to the Pontoons is secured by electronic keypads with codes, so give us a ring from the car park when you arrive and we’ll come up to meet you.
