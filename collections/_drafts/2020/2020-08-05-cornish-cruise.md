Change this !!! This was our first opportunity to take Anika on a longer cruise with an overnight passage. With all the Brexit stuff going on we decided to head west along the English south coast and just see how far we get before having to turn back east towards home. 

Why Gorran Haven? Having joked about it many times over a glass of wine, our mission is to get a photo of Anika anchored in the bay from our friends house in Gorran Haven. 

### Day 1 - River Hamble to Poole Harbour
Passing the Needles on the first leg of our 150nm trip to Gorran Haven in Cornwall. A relatively short passage from Hamble to Poole Quay, so that we can better time our rounding of Portland Bill to catch the tide on day 2.

Moored up in Poole Quay Boat Haven, chatting to our neighbours about boats and sailing plans. Finished off my anchor splice, extending Anika’s anchor chain with 40m of new Octoplait anchor warp. When we get to Gorran Haven we may need to anchor in slightly deeper water than usual. My splice is a work of art. ⚓️⛓🧶

### Day 2 - Poole Harbour to Gorran Haven (overnight sail across Lyme Bay)
The Big One, our first overnight passage and our longest passage to date.

We were on the fuel dock at 8:30am ready to set off on the 125nm passage from Poole Quay to Gorran Haven. MDL’s fuel dock on the Hamble had a “technical fault” the day before 🤦🏻‍♂️, and having phoned round all the fuel docks in the area this was our last chance to top up the tanks before setting off across Lyme Bay. Not much wind forecast for most of the day so assumed we would be motoring for a large part of it. Lovely cruise past Old Harry heading for our waypoint, 5 miles off Portland Bill.

We passed Portland Bill 5 miles offshore with barely a ripple on the water. In the middle of Lyme Bay a huge pod of dolphins came to visit us. I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many dolphins at once.

After the dolphin display we finished supper and prepared for a night sail that would take us around Start Point and passing south of the Eddystone Lighthouse in Devon on our way to Cornwall. And the sunset was a bit special too.

### Day 3 - Arrive Gorran Haven
125nm and 23 hours after we left Poole, we arrived as planned in the bay of Gorran Haven. Just got to get that picture we came for 📷 and it will be mission accomplished!

So here it it, the picture we came for. Stunning view out across the bay, but this time with a familiar boat anchored up 😉
