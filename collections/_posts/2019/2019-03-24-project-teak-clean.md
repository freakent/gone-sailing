We often get lots of compliments on Anika’s deck and people ask how we did it, so here goes. 

Although teak wood is incredibly hard wearing, you do have to treat it with some consideration.
The enemy of any teak deck is a brush. Heavy brushing along the grain will eventually just rub 
the the teak away. It’s fair to say Anika has a lot of teak on her deck. I’d much rather put 
effort into looking after the teak than face the bill for replacing it all one day. 

The broker had the teak cleaned just before we completed the purchase of Anika, although it 
looked good it gradually went a very dull shade of grey over the winter. There were also a few 
patches that were starting to go a bit green where water had collected a little. Our boat 
“coach” James offered to help us clean and protects the teak and showed us how to use the 3 
step clean, renovate and seal teak cleaning products. 

### Step 1 - Clean
After soaking the deck with fresh water from the hose, the cleaning product we used was the 
Onward Trading Company concentrated Part One Teak Cleaner. It was diluted in a bucket with 
clean water. We applied it using kitchen washing up sponges, working small areas at a time.

It’s wicked stuff. I thought it would be a good idea to wear my rubber gardening gloves to 
protect my hands. After about an hour or so I realised my hands felt wet. I took my gloves 
off and found that I had a couple of nasty looking chemical burns on one hand. You know things 
must be serious when you have a hole in your finger but it doesn’t hurt one bit. And for the 
next week using my iPhone was a bit tricky as I didn’t have any finger prints! Note to self: 
gardening gloves do not offer adequate protection against hazardous chemicals, wear kitchen 
Marigolds instead.

After cleaning each section, that section of the deck was thoroughly rinsed down with water 
from the hose. You could clearly see the dirt and muck washing right off, and the colour of 
the teak starting to appear. In hindsight it would have been a god idea to thoroughly rinse 
the sides of the hull too as the chemicals did leave some streaks down the side that I will 
now have to polish out.

### Step 2 - Renovate
Once a large section was cleaned and rinsed we moved onto Onward Trading Company concentrated 
Part Two Teak Renovator. This was also diluted with water in another bucket, and also applied 
to small areas using a kitchen sponge. You can immediately see the teak’s deep reddish colour 
turning a more fresher golden colour. As each section was treated they were again given a good
rinse off using the hose pipe. 

### Step 3 - "Semco" Teak Sealer
This was by far the most rewarding step as finish turns the teaks
