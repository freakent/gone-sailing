Just the two of us, seeing in 2019 from New Town Creek.

That's another Christmas done. Our family has gone back home and Son is back at Uni
to celebrate the New Year with his student friends. What better way to see in the New Year than an overnight stop in the tranquil surroundings of New Town Creek on the Isle of Wight. From up on deck we watched all the fireworks on the mainland and cracked open a bottle of bubbly. It was definitely a lot colder than we expected so we didn't stay on deck after the strike of midnight for very long. But what a beautiful place to wake up on News Year Day.
