And we’re off! After what feels like weeks of preparation this is day 1 of our “West Coast Odyssey”. 

We’re starting off with a short sail from Hamble River to Yarmouth, Isle of Wight. Very busy on Southampton Water with one big cruise ship to avoid. Now moored up on buoy outside Yarmouth, enjoying watching people trying to pick up buoys.
