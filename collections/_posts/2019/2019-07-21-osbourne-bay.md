An excellent day of firsts; first time we’ve anchored in Osborne Bay on the Isle-of-Wight, first time we’ve had to reef _Anika_’s main sail, first time out with all three vertical battens in the main. 

With low water being around lunch time, we decided to make a stop into Osbourne Bay on our way the Beaulieu River. By late afternoon the tide wouldn't be against us so much, plus there would be more water to help us get over the Beaulieu bar. There is loads of room to anchor in Osbourne Bay and the depth stays fairly flat all the way across the bay. The only drawback was that the IOW mud was very hard to shift off the anchor!
