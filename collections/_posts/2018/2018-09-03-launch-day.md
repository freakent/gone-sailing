With the surveyors report and final negotiations completed, next step was to
get Anika back into the water ready for the sea trial. 

The boat yard has a sling crane that they use to move boats around the marina. As buyers, we were responsible for paying for the launch and fuel for the sea trial.
Her 115 litre tanks were absolutely empty so our first trip on Anika was to be a
short one up the River Hamble to Port Hamble Marina fuel dock.
